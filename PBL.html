        <h2 style="text-align: center;">What is Flood Prevention?</h2>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Flood Prevention methods are used to reduce or prevent the detrimental effects of flood waters. Flooding can be caused by a mix of both natural processes, such as extreme weather upstream, and human changes to waterbodies and runoff.</p>
        <br>
        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Why do we need Flood Prevention measures?</h2>
        <p>Flood preventative measures are aimed at reducing the likelihood and/or severity of flood events. These measures, typically requiring physical works, can reduce risk in a range of ways, such as by defending areas at risk against flooding, by reducing or diverting the peak flood flows, or by reducing flood levels.</p>
        <br style="text-align: center;">
        <h2 style="text-align: center;">An example of Flood Prevention Measures</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> Dams to collect extra water</li>
            <li> Drainage System to drain excess water </li>
        </ul>
        <h2 style="text-align: center;">How is the model related to the topic?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The physical model is based on Mitigation of Flood Risks</li>
            <li>The Mincecraft Model is based on the Drainage of the Mughal Cities</li>
            <li>The White represents the Recycled materials used to keep it sustainable</li>
            <li>And finally, The Solar Pannels represent solar energy for the model</li>
        </ul>
